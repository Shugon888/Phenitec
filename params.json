Such that, it appears that everyone became dependent on the technological revolution and its application. Then, it became apparent, the usefulness and the advantages of the technology and its application in the modern world, transforming everything into something easy, portable and handy. Recently, several programs were developed and are available for a specific function and use. For instance, software for inferring the phenotype and/or genotype of a test crosses which is now available on line. However, such program cannot be accessed without an internet connection. Henceforth, the present work attempted to create a program to come up with an application in the elucidation of task or activity in the study of heredity and variation in the laboratory. The study came up with a process of inferring the genotype and/or phenotype in a test cross between animals or plants of a given species. The results of the study put an ease in inferring the results of a given test cross which is usually done manually. Using the C++ program, an application was developed for inferring a test cross between a given species of plant or animal.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
