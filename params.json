{"name":"Phenitec","tagline":"Bioinformatics","body":"### Welcome to Phenitec.\r\n<html>\r\n<h1>Overview</h1>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\nIn recent time, the application of the technological concepts became evident and visible in almost and every walk of life in the society, industries, schools and universities, place of worship, agriculture and in every direction of endeavor. Such that, it appears that everyone became dependent on the technological revolution and its application. Then, it became apparent, the usefulness and the advantages of the technology and its application in the modern world, transforming everything into something easy, portable and handy. Recently, several programs were developed and are available for a specific function and use. For instance, software for inferring the phenotype and/or genotype of a test crosses which is now available on line. However, such program cannot be accessed without an internet connection. Henceforth, the present work attempted to create a program to come up with an application in the elucidation of task or activity in the study of heredity and variation in the laboratory. The study came up with a process of inferring the genotype and/or phenotype in a test cross between animals or plants of a given species. The results of the study put an ease in inferring the results of a given test cross which is usually done manually. Using the C++ program, an application was developed for inferring a test cross between a given species of plant or animal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n![Result 1](http://oi66.tinypic.com/28rcpx5.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Result 2](http://oi67.tinypic.com/besrqh.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Result 3](http://oi63.tinypic.com/2vt32c0.jpg)\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">In view of the results of the present study, it is inferred that:\r\n<br><br>\r\nA. It is possible to apply information technology concept in biological probe, such as in inferring a test cross between heterozygous traits.\r\n</br>\r\n<br><br>\r\nB. The test cross is possible off-line because of the encoded program or codes \r\n</br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recommendation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The present study was able to come up with a program that can be utilized in the field of Biology, specifically in Genetics that is inferring of the genotype and the phenotype traits in a test cross between two identifiable characteristics.\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, because of the limit of time, only tests cross between heterozygous was done.\r\n</br> \r\n</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">It is recommended that further study should be done to elucidate further the inference of the following:</p>\r\n1. A test crosses between two homozygous traits,\r\n</br><br>\r\n2. A test crosses between homozygous and heterozygous traits, and\r\n</br><br>\r\n3. Test cross inference of multiple traits.\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"Right\">Powered by: A. N. Olea\r\nEstablished: 03/01/2016\r\nCopyright by A. N.
